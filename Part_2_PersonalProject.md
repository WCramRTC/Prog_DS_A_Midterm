Adding a personal projects repository to your GitHub profile is a great way to showcase your coding skills, interests, and commitment to personal development to potential employers or collaborators. Here's a detailed guide on how to proceed, whether you're starting a new project or adding an existing one:

### If You Have an Existing Project:
1. **Evaluate Your Project**: Ensure your project is a good representation of your skills. It should be well-documented, including a README file that explains what the project does, how to set it up, and how to use it. The code should be clean and well-commented.

2. **Implement a Custom Data Structure**: Review the project to identify opportunities to incorporate a custom-built data structure (e.g., linked list, binary tree, hash map, graph). The implementation should not rely solely on the language's standard library but should showcase your understanding of the data structure's concepts and your ability to implement it from scratch.

3. **Update Your Project**: Refactor your project to include the custom data structure. This might involve redesigning certain components or adding new features that leverage your data structure. Ensure you thoroughly test your code to maintain functionality.

4. **Push to GitHub**: If your project is not already on GitHub, initialize a git repository in your project directory, add your files, commit them, and push them to a new repository on GitHub. If it's already on GitHub, commit your changes and push them.

### If You Need to Create a New Project:
1. **Choose a Project Idea**: Select an idea that interests you and demonstrates your coding skills. Consider projects that solve a problem you're passionate about or that could be useful to others.

2. **Plan Your Project**: Outline the features and functionalities you want to include. Decide on the programming language and tools you'll use. Make sure your project scope includes implementing a custom data structure.

3. **Start Coding**: Begin with a basic structure and progressively build up your project. Focus on making incremental progress, and use version control (git) to manage your changes. Implement the custom data structure early in the development process, as it will likely be integral to your project's functionality.

4. **Document Your Progress**: Keep detailed documentation from the start. This includes a README file, inline code comments, and possibly a wiki or external documentation site if the project is large or complex.

5. **Push to GitHub**: Once you've made significant progress and have implemented a custom data structure, push your project to GitHub. Ensure your repository is organized and includes a clear README with setup and usage instructions.

### General Tips:
- **Showcase Your Skills**: Choose a project that showcases a range of skills, including coding, problem-solving, and project management.
- **Engage with the Community**: Open your project to issues and contributions from others. This can provide valuable feedback and demonstrate your ability to work collaboratively.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Don’t stop working on your project once it’s on GitHub. Continue to refine, optimize, and add features over time.

### Checking with Your Instructor:
If your project is related to schoolwork and is large in scope, it’s crucial to discuss it with your instructor. They can provide guidance on whether the project is suitable for your GitHub profile and what aspects might need to be adjusted to meet the criteria of incorporating a custom data structure.

By following these steps, you'll not only enrich your GitHub profile but also deepen your understanding of data structures and software development practices.

## For your README.md make sure to include

- Project Name
- Paragraph Explain your topic
- Your goal with the project ( what you want to build or what you plan to learn )
- Some of the frameworks or languages you have decided on 
- Set some milestones. What do you plan to add in the future.

This should not be considered short term but a project you will talk about at an interview one day.

## Rubric

Adjusting the rubric to reallocate points from "Engagement and Community Interaction" to "Continuous Improvement and Learning," here is the updated table:

| **Criteria**                          | **Points** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Relevance and Complexity**  | 20         | Assesses how well the project aligns with industry standards and job relevance. The complexity should demonstrate the ability to solve significant problems.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Implementation of Data Structures** | 20         | Evaluates the custom implementation of data structures or algorithms, showcasing an understanding of their concepts and the ability to build from scratch.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Code Quality and Documentation**    | 20         | Considers the cleanliness of the code, the presence of meaningful comments, and comprehensive documentation including a README that clearly explains the project's setup, usage, and features.                                                                                                  |
| **Project Innovation and Problem Solving** | 15         | Rewards creative solutions to problems, the use of technology in novel ways, and the project's ability to address real-world issues.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Version Control and Development Process** | 10         | Looks at the use of version control (e.g., Git), including commit history quality, and the ability to discuss the development process, planning, and challenges faced.                                                                                                                           |
| **Continuous Improvement and Learning** | 15         | Evaluates evidence of ongoing project refinement, feature additions, adaptation to feedback, and learning of new skills through the project. This category now also reflects the importance of being open to learning from the community and integrating feedback to improve.                     |

This revised rubric increases the emphasis on continuous improvement and learning, reflecting a more significant focus on personal development and the iterative nature of software development.
