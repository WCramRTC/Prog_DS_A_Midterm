# Programming - Data Algorithms - Midterm

For this midterm it will consist of 3 seperate parts


## Part 1: Create and Fill Out your GitHub Profile  
### Full Info: [GitHub Profile](#github-profile)  

Here are the distilled requirements and tasks from the GitHub Profile README assignment, presented as short bullet points for clarity:

- **Repository Setup**
  - Log in to GitHub.
  - Create a new repository named after your GitHub username.
  - Make the repository public.
  - Initialize with a README file.

- **Customize README**
  - Edit README.md to introduce yourself and share your interests.
  - Include at least the Contributions counter addon.
  - Commit your changes.

- **Content Requirements for README**
  - Introduce Yourself: Name, role/title, and a brief bio.
  - State Your Goals: Learning goals or career aspirations.
  - Technologies and Skills: List of technologies and programming languages.
  - Showcase Projects: Overview of your best or favorite projects with links.

- **Additional Requirements**
  - Link at least 3 repositories: Personal Project (See Part 2), best repository, and the 3rd part of this assignment.
  
- **Styling and Formatting**
  - Use Markdown for formatting README.
  - Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs for readability.
  - Consistently format your profile for a professional look.
  - Regularly update your profile to reflect new skills or projects.

  
To create a rubric for the GitHub profile README assignment as described, we can assign points based on the completeness, quality, and creativity of the required elements. Here's a suggested rubric out of 100 points, distributed across various criteria:

## Part 2: Add your Personal Projects Repository to your GitHub Profile
### Full Info: [Personal Project](#personal-project)  
- You can add one that you have already been working on
- If you do not have one yet, you must create and have made coding progress on it.
- If there is one you did make for school, but it is large in scope, check with me for an ok.
- You MUST implement one of the data structures we've learned into your project. And it must be custom built, not just using the built in library.

| **Criteria**                          | **Points** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Continuous Improvement and Learning** | 15         | Evaluates evidence of ongoing project refinement, feature additions, adaptation to feedback, and learning of new skills through the project. This category now also reflects the importance of being open to learning from the community and integrating feedback to improve.                     |

This revised rubric increases the emphasis on continuous improvement and learning, reflecting a more significant focus on personal development and the iterative nature of software development.

## Part 3a - Due with the Midterm: 
### Full Info: [Queue and Stack](#queue-and-stack)
1. Create a new Project called DataStructures_YourName.
2. Comment your name at the type
3. Submit this Repository online AND
4. Post the repo link on your profile
5. Do the following process ( make sure to comment your code )
6. Add 4 Classes to this project.

- LinkedList - Singly

## Part 3b - Due week AFTER the Midterm:
### Create "A Queue that is created out of two stacks"
- You CANNOT use the built in LinkedList, Queue, or Stack in the Dotnet library.
- You must create your own custom Stack class
    - The Stack class must implement the following methods
        - Pop
        - Push
        - Peek
        - Empty
        - Search
- The Stack class must be created using a linked list data structure
    - The Stack must NOT use an array or list as a data structure.
    - Behind the scenes, the stack must be built usings Node's with refrences, like a linked list.
