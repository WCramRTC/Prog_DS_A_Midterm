# Programming - Data Algorithms - Midterm

For this midterm it will consist of 3 seperate parts

- [GitHub Profile](#github-profile)
Part 1: Create and Fill Out your GitHub Profile

- [Personal Project](#personal-project)
Part 2: Add your Personal Projects Repository to your GitHub Profile
- You can add one that you have already been working on
- If you do not have one yet, you must create and have made coding progress on it.
- If there is one you did make for school, but it is large in scope, check with me for an ok.
- You MUST implement one of the data structures we've learned into your project. And it must be custom built, not just using the built in library.


- [Queue and Stack](#queue-and-stack)
## Part 3a - Due with the Midterm: 



## Part 3b - Due week AFTER the Midterm:
### Create "A Queue that is created out of two stacks"
- You CANNOT use the built in LinkedList, Queue, or Stack in the Dotnet library.
- You must create your own custom Stack class
    - The Stack class must implement the following methods
        - Pop
        - Push
        - Peek
        - Empty
        - Search
- The Stack class must be created using a linked list data structure
    - The Stack must NOT use an array or list as a data structure.
    - Behind the scenes, the stack must be built usings Node's with refrences, like a linked list.
